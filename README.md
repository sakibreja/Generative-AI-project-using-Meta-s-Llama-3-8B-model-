# Generative-AI-project-using-Meta-s-Llama-3-8B-model-

ðŸš€ Just deployed a Generative AI project using Meta's Llama-3-8B model!
Developed an end-to-end text generation pipeline leveraging:
âœ… Meta Llama-3-8B (4-bit quantized via BitsAndBytes)
âœ… Hugging Face Transformers for model integration
âœ… PyTorch with CUDA optimization
âœ… Advanced quantization techniques (NF4, double quantization)

Key Achievements:
ðŸ”¹ Implemented 4-bit model quantization for efficient GPU usage
ðŸ”¹ Engineered dynamic text generation with 128-token sequences
ðŸ”¹ Integrated safe tensor loading for large model deployment
ðŸ”¹ Achieved T4 GPU utilization for inference tasks
